# Seeing Stars: A Computer Vision-Centered Approach for Star Rating in the Hospitality Industry
With over 10 million hotels globally, there is a need for travel booking websites to provide accurate
and reliable information to visitors. Star rating is most frequently used as a filtering criterion, but is
unreliable given the absence of commonly accepted standards for star rating assignment. Manual
human verification can be subjective and incurs high operating costs. Several major third-party
distribution platforms, e.g., Booking.com, therefore let hotel owners self-report their own star ratings,
with highly inconsistent results.

Our objective is to create a computer-vision-assisted machine learning model that can more accurately
assign hotel star ratings using images and meta-data (e.g. pricing, facilities). This promises a cheaper
and more objective methodology in assigning hotel star ratings.
